### Welcome to my portfolio! I hope you enjoy some of the projects that I have been building in my free time as a university student. 

## Version 1 (deprecated) - Java Spring codestar project w/ CI/CD pipeline
## Version 2 (current) - Static website hosting on s3 w/ SSL Certificate

### Recently I have moved the website from an old repository to this new one. The old website's stack demonstrates an in depth understanding of more AWS services but in the end the solution was too complicated and powerful for a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript website. This website does not need to use AWS's CI/CD tools or build tools like Maven. I decided to save on costs and create a static version instead. 

### Anyone can throw services at their project until it works. But understanding on a fundamental level the scope of your application and the technologies best suited for it will allow you to choose the best (and simplest) solution in the long run; and as a result, save you valuable resources and time.

#### *Note: Safari does not correctly display the responsive settings for the main page of the site. It does not even display the correct font. Working on a fix.
